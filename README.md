Thanks for trying out my AssureSign Delete App!

To Start run the following:

cd server
npm install
npm start

cd client
npm install
npm start

Provide the CSV file of the Envelopes to be deleted. The columns of the CSV file must include:
1. Name
2. EnvelopeId
3. AuthToken

The DocumentNOW Account Context Identifier is required. This can be found in AssureSign Administration > Settings

Please contact Katie if there are any issues.
